# Crossby Road

## Phase 1: Concept and Design

<!-- Brainstorm a concept for your VR experience, drawing inspiration from the articles.
Sketch a basic design for your virtual environment, considering elements like nature, Earth, space, wildlife, humanity, and the emotional impact you want to convey. -->

Inspired of following game, Crossy Road, I decided to develop the endless hopper mobile game similar to it. I will implement some basic functionalities of the game, such as grass terrain, road terrain, vehicle, player, and user interface including button, score, and high score.

<blockquote>
Crossy Road is the 8-bit endless arcade hopper that started it all. Collect custom characters and navigate freeways, railroads, rivers and much more.

## Phase 2: Asset Compilation

<!-- Use readily available 3D models, textures, and assets (or create simple ones) to build your virtual environment.
Ensure that the assets align with your chosen theme and design. -->
